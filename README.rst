What is this?
--------

When trying to learn about Jung's personality archetypes I arrived to the conclusion that
I'm not able to retain all the information about all the personalities, temperaments,
functions, positions in the stack, etc.

After gasping the model structure, I was able to understasnd that there is a multivariable
structure based on the function stacks, and then there are different projections over which
conclusions can be taken.

But my inhability to keep track of the information didn't allow me to evaluate if the conclusions
allow the model to hold internal consistency, let alone contrast the model with reality.

This is my attempt to generate, through an hyperdocument and (hopefully) an interactive concept map,
an annotation of every new concept I learn about this, err, craft?
